## SECURITY GROUP
### THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT SECURITY GROUP
AWS Security Groups help you secure your cloud environment by controlling
how traffic will be allowed into your EC2 machines. With Security Groups,
you can ensure that all the traffic that flows at the instance level is 
only through your established ports and protocols.
When launching an instance on Amazon EC2, you need to assign it to a 
particular security group. You can add rules to each security group that
allow traffic to or from designated services including associated instances.
### SECURITY GROUPS HAS TWO ROUTE INBOUND AND OUTBOUND
