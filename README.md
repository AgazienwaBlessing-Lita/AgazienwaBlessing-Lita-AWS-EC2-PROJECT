### AWS HOME PAGE / ENVIRONMENT
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world-leading cloud 
technologies that help any organization and any individual build 
solutions to transform industries, communities, and lives for the better.
Whether they are entrepreneurs launching new businesses, established 
companies reinventing themselves, non-profits working to advance their
missions, or governments and cities seeking to serve their citizens more 
effectively.

### VPC CREATION
I used the vpc created by our instructors because we have reached the 
number of vpc's to be created in AWS for free.
